    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About Medicinal Plant Identifier</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>Medicinal Plant Identifier</strong> is a cutting-edge project designed to utilize advanced image processing 
        and machine learning technologies to identify medicinal plants from images of their leaves. This project not only identifies 
        the plant but also provides a wealth of information about its medicinal uses, benefits, and geographic locations, making it an 
        invaluable tool for botanists, healthcare professionals, and nature enthusiasts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Plant Identification:</strong> Upload an image of a plant's leaf, and the system will predict the plant type using a trained 
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plant Information:</strong> Detailed information about the plant, including its medicinal uses, health benefits, and primary 
            locations, is displayed after identification.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plant Care Recommendations:</strong> Provides guidance on how to grow and care for the identified plant, including its sunlight 
            requirements, watering schedule, soil type, and additional tips.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recipe Suggestions:</strong> Offers recipes that utilize the identified plant, highlighting its edible and medicinal applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Symptom Checker:</strong> Allows users to input symptoms and receive a list of medicinal plants that may help alleviate their conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Image Upload and Display:</strong> Users can upload an image, view the uploaded image, and receive all related information in an 
            easy-to-navigate interface.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
        The project is powered by a deep learning model based on MobileNet architecture, trained on a diverse dataset of medicinal plant images. 
        Here’s how the process works:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Users upload an image of a plant's leaf.
        </li>
        <li>
            The system processes the image and extracts features using the pre-trained CNN model.
        </li>
        <li>
            The model predicts the plant type based on the extracted features and matches it with a database of known medicinal plants.
        </li>
        <li>
            The identified plant’s details, including uses, benefits, and care tips, are fetched from a connected SQLite database.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional features like recipes and symptom-based plant recommendations enhance user experience.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> TensorFlow/Keras for training and deploying the CNN model.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Flask framework for building the back-end API and rendering web pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQLite for storing plant-related data, including care instructions, recipes, and symptom mappings.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> OpenCV and Keras preprocessing for preparing images before prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Makes This Project Unique?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Educational Value:</strong> Provides detailed knowledge about medicinal plants, their properties, and how they are used 
            in traditional and modern medicine.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Practical Applications:</strong> Can be used in fields like botany, healthcare, and agriculture for plant identification 
            and utilization.
        </li>
